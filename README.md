Hi, I made a simple Python app that helps you send mail from your Gmail account to any other account,

1-	After downloading the files, you need to go to the "IMPORTANT" folder which contains images showing how to allow third-party apps to access your Gmail
â€¢	Just from the settings page, the home page of Google:
o	https://myaccount.google.com/?utm_source=account-marketing-page&utm_medium=go-to-account-button&pli=1

2-	Create a new project from your IDE like PyCharm etc.

3-	 Copy the code from gmail.py file to your project

4-	 Very important! copy the images in the folder to your project folder.

5-	 Finally run the code,

6-	If you want to convert the program to an .exe file, go to YouTube, as there are many sources.

Have fun
